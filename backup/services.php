             <h3>3D Animation</h3>
             <p>Creating original and <b>bespoke 3D animations</b> for demonstrations, tutorials and generally showing off your products is what I do best. During the time that I have been working for myself this has been my bread and butter and the main reason I decided to go out on my own. With the use of Autodesk 3D Studio Max Design and the Adobe Suite I am able to create anything from high detail breakdowns of products through to much larger scenes that still retain a high level of detail.</p>
             <h3>Still Frame Rendering</h3>
             <p>This is where a good knowledge of rendering techniques is key to success. <b>Rendering architechtural</b> scenes has been something I have played around with for quite some time, pretty much as far back as when I first started using <b>3D Studio Max</b>. With the use of high resoultion textures and realistic materials I am able to create near photo realistic renders of pretty much anything. This could be a shot of a new product for use in media prior to its construction or just to show off something that you are particularly proud of.</p>
             <h3>Props for Games</h3>
             <p>As a keen "gamer" I have grown up around the evolution of <b>3D graphics in games</b> having spent my early days around consoles like Sega's Megadrive to more recently PC gaming. Creating high detail; or low for that matter, props is another thing that I have constantly been doing since starting up with 3D Studio Max. During university there were a number of modules that required the creation of models that would be suitable for use withing a game environment, the skills I learnt during this time with regards to keeping models simple where possible and using textures to highlight small details is something that I apply to all areas of <b>3D modelling</b>. This is a field I have a high interest for and something I actively strive to seak out.</p>
             <h3>Video Production</h3>
             <p>As you would expect, I produce all the videos myself with the rendered outputs. This includes editing the raw footage to create a final product which is cohesive, smooth and above all else professional. You can see from the videos that I currently have under the portfolio that company branding is something I take very seriously. If I produce a video for you, you own it.</p>
             <h3>Web development and design</h3>
             <p>What started off as creating this website has eveolved into a money maker in itself. Using skills I learnt at university along with a course I recently completed on Udemy I have created a number websites for clients based on their specifications using HTML, CSS, Jquery and PHP.</p>
             <h3>What to do next?</h3>
             <p>If you have any questions relating to the services I have to offer then please do not hesitate to contact me via the contact form on this website or by phone. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
