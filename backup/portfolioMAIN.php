                    <span>Pinning a Brisant Lock</span>
                    <p>This video was created to demonstrate to locksmiths how quickly and easily a Brisant lock can be stripped down and pinned up to be keyed alike. All materials contained within the scene were created within 3D Stuido Max and lit with spot lights to simulate reflections and specularity. All other images that were used post render in Premiere were created using Photoshop and animated with Premiere to achieve the highlight effect.</p>

                    <span>How Brisant's Ultion Works</span>
                    <p>This video is simply showing the operation of Brisants revolutionary Ultion lock. The reasoning behind this is to show consumers and locksmiths how this lock operates differently from other products currently available. Again, the materials in this scene were created in 3D Studio Max. The lighting and background were exported from the pinning video to maintain consistency throughout the Brisant videos.</p>

                    <span>Brisant's Ultion Bump Resistance</span>
                    <p>Lock bumping is a serious threat to the security of homes with inferior locks. This video demonstrates how a standard lock is bumped and how an Ultion lock resists the same attack. The materials used on the hammer were initially created within Photoshop and touched up with a specular and bump maps in 3D Studio Max. </p>

                    <span>Brisant's Thumb Turn Conversion</span>
                    <p>This video was created to show locksmiths how easy it is to convert a Brisant lock from standard operation to a key and thumbturn system. As with the other videos for Brisant, the scene back drop, lighting and materials have been shared to remain consistant. </p>

                    <span>Brisant's Snap Resistant Ultion</span>
                    <p>Brisant's Ultion lock is unique in its methods of reisting a snap attack. This video shows what happens at each stage of a snap attack and how the Ultion prevents access through the door it is installed into. The rusted metal effect on the mole grips was created using brush work in Photoshop and applied to a 3D Studio Max metal material under bump and specular to simulate a rough and slightly reflective material.</p>

                    <p>Brisants key plugs have a unique design which prevents attacks through the use of a drill. The key feature in this video with regards to its production is the use of particle effects. This is something that I enjoy working with as the results can be incredibly varied in appearance to suit a whole range of purposes. This is a very simply particle generator creating three sided polygons coloured to match the lock.</p>

                    <span>How to adjust a Trojan hinge</span>
                    <p>This video demonstrates to customers the methods required to adjust the Trojan hinge provided by Door Stop. This was created to aid the customer service team, as opposed to explaining over the phone how to adjust the hinge customers can be shown the video which takes them through the process step by step. The animation process for this is reletively simple but simplicity was key in this video to show how easy the adjustments actually are.</p>

                    <span>How to reverse a lock</span>
                    <p>As the title suggests this is a tutorial on how to reverse the direction of a lock. As with the majority of videos produced for Door Stop making this as simple as possible was the highest priority. A few of the less important details surrounding the lock have been left out so that the customer is left with an identifiable region of the lock with only the pieces that need adjusting to reverse their lock. This creates less distractions and enables customers to focus on what actually needs changing.</p>

                    <p>This is another tutorial video showing customers how they would fit a split spindal to their door and what differences there are over a standard spindal. It was important to keep this video short and concise again to help customers see what is required to successfully fit a split spindal. All animations created for Door Stop have been made in the same framework and from the same camera path where possible to retain consistency throughout.</p>

                    <p>This being one of the longer animations created for Door Stop and from which some of the other videos were cut from. The animation during this project contained the same procedures as some of the other tutorials that Door Stop hired me to do such as changing a door handle. Rather than making more files with fresh animation, I kept the camera setup and environments identical so that I could render all the footage from this animation and then cut out the sections I would need for the other videos.</p>

                    <span>Locks around the home</span>
                    <p>This image was created using 3D Studio Max to highlight the different locks around the house that Euro-Secure provides. The brief was to build a house that could be "x-rayed" through to show locks on both the front and back of the house. This was done by slicing the polygons on the walls into a different layer and then simply applying a no render material to them.</p>

                    <p>This animation is for home owners to see how this particular lock resists snap attacks. Looking at the video itself a number of techniques have been used to achieve the final product such as reversing footage to keep render times down and slicing polygons and apply no render materials to simulate an "x-ray" effect.</p>
