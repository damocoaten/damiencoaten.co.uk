             <h2>Graphic Designer and 3D Animator - Nottingham</h2>
             <p>I'm Damien and I am a freelance 3D graphic artist specialising in <strong>3D animation, graphic design and web design.</strong> I graduated from Nottingham Trent University with a 2:1 in Digital Media Technology in 2014, during this time I found my passion for 3D design specifically 3D animation and video production. From there I worked on my existing skills in my own time and began to develop other aspects of model creation, video production and sound editting. You can find my current portfolio by following the link above, this will be in a state of constant update so feel free to check back from time to time to see what I have been getting up to.</p>
             <p>During my University experience it allowed an expansion of skills which has now included Graphic Design work and Web Design. This involves working with software such as the <strong>Adobe Suite</strong> and also working with <strong>HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP</strong></p>
             <p>But thats enough about me, I'd like to hear from you. If you have any questions with regards to my work or would like to chat to me about a project you have in mind please feel free to contact me via email, phone or by the form on my contact page.</p>
