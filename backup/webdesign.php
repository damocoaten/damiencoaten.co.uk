        <h2>Web Design Examples</h2>
             <p>Here are just some of the examples of work I have creating using software such as the Adobe Suite and implementing skills with HTML and CSS. This includes working with responsive media queries to ensure websites are mobile friendly and also understanding Javascript, jQuery and PHP.</p>

                    <span>Visit Site</span></a>
                    <h3>Brisant Secure</h3>
                    <p>Brisant Secure was designed externally and coded by myself; as well as the animations present throughout the site. It is aimed towards locksmiths as an informative guide and a method of purchasing Brisant products.<br><br>The previous version of Brisant Secure was very dated and mostly coded in tables so after scrapping most of what was there it is now fully responsive for mobile browsing with a much more aesthetically pleasing appearance.</p>

                    <h3>Euro Secure</h3>
                    <p>Euro Secure was again designed externally for me to code up. This site is for e-commerce purposes aimed at home owners looking to secure their homes.<br><br>Most of the code regarding the e-commerce section of the site was completed before I arrived to finish the front end, although working alongside other developers during this time allowed me to learn from what they were doing.</p><br>

                    <h3>Lock Advisor</h3>
                    <p>Lock Advisor was the first site that I saw through from design to code. This site serves more purpose as an online leaflet providing information about security products and the need for better security.<br><br> The design of this site began with myself and the client discussing themes and colour schemes going through an iterative design process until an appealing design was reached. From here work started on the coding of the site while an external company worked on the police API.</p>

                    <br><h3> Damien Coaten Media</h3>
                    <p>And of course there is my website. This has been created to advertise myself as a freelance graphic and web designer as well as an online portfolio.<br><br>Over the last 8 months this site has changed from a very simple portfolio displaying work I had completed during my time at university to a self advertising website with information of projects I have completed since going freelance. I wanted to keep the design of the site clean and simple so that the focus is the content.</p>
